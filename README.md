# Cardify App

This is a simple web app where users can place orders for Banking Cards.

## Installation

Firstly clone the repo to your Local Machine

Use npm to install all needed packages.

```bash
npm install
```

## Setting Up Guide

I provided an example env file that should guide you on what Environment Variables are needed to make the code work on your machine. It is located at the `config.env.exmaple` file. Use this guide and create a `config.env` file and input the needed variables.

## Running

To run the app locally using Nodemon use the following command

```bash
npm run dev
```

To run the app locally using Node use the following command

```bash
npm run start

The Local Site should be running on the folowing URL. Copy and paste on your browser after successfully running the app locally.

## Future Considerations

- Adding a mailing system that welcomes users when they signup.
- Creating a separate dashboard for Bank-Representatives to view and complete orders made by users.
- Creating a page for users to check their ongoing orders.
